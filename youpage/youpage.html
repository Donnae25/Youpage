        My name is Donnae Ashford. I was born in Chicago, IL. I'm a wife, and a mother of three. And a future tech geek! I am very much enjoying my experience being apart of Cycle 51 with i.c.stars. 
    </p>
    <p style="color:blue">
        I have been working in customer service since the age of 16. I've also worked in the food industry/grocery industry for places like Mariano' and Jamba Juice.

    <p> I <i>ended</i> up with these hobbies. Because as a <b>kid</b> I was very shy. So, I acquired these <u>hobbies</u> to given me comfort in uncertain times. Because if I couldn't lean on anyone else, at least I know that I had my talents.
